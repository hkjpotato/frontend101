  //->7.5/10 too much new concepts, but good

  //what is a mutation exactly? Mutations are in-place changes to data or the data structures that contain it. Immutability on the other hand, makes a copy of such data and data structures whenever a change is required.

  /*

  key concepts:
  1. immutable
  2. persistent
  3. copy is just creating a reference to the existing instance
    why? since everything is not changable, using the same instance is safe
  4. comparision is by reference

  Immutable data structures go hand-in-hand with side-effect free functions.

  pure functions rely only on what is explicitly passed to them as arguments to produce a result. In other words, pure functions must not rely on global state or state accessible through other constructs.
