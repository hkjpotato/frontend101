/*
Mixins introduce implicit dependencies
Mixins cause name clashes
Mixins cause snowballing complexity
*/

//first of all, there are different forms of mixins

//e.g. Object.assign

class Todo {
  constructor (name) {
    this.name = name || 'Untitled';
    this.done = false;
  }
  do () {
    this.done = true;
    return this;
  }
  undo () {
    this.done = false;
    return this;
  }
}

const Coloured = {
  setColourRGB ({r, g, b}) {
    this.colourCode = {r, g, b};
    return this;
  },
  getColourRGB () {
    return this.colourCode;
  }
};

Object.assign(Todo.prototype, Coloured); //implicit dependency
//we don't know, from this line of code, that we are introducing two additional methods on the Todo.prototype

new Todo('test')
  .setColourRGB({r: 1, g: 2, b: 3})
  //=> {"name":"test","done":false,"colourCode":{"r":1,"g":2,"b":3}}

//Note that our mixin simply grows our class’ prototype via copying, a process sometimes called “concatenative sharing.” 


/*
In short, the concatenative sharing mechanism permits the maximum possible set of dependencies between the class and its mixins. This is a problem, because these dependencies exemplify the complete opposite of the principles of encapsulation: The point of encapsulation is to define an interface through which entities interact with each other. Each entity then implements its behaviour using private methods and properties that are hidden from other entities.
*/

//es6 module let us use explicit dependencies by export and import certain methods/value/...


/*
name clash

const Coloured = {
  setColourName (name) {
    this.name = name;
  },
  setColourRGB ({r, g, b}) {
    this.colourCode = {r, g, b};
    return this;
  },
  getColourName () {
    return this.name;
  },
  getColourRGB () {
    return this.colourCode;
  }
};

It turns out that with class hierarchies, we have a fragile base class problem and a many-to-many dependencies problem. Mixins solve the many-to-many dependencies problem, but spread out the fragile base class problem and introduce new vectors for dependencies between mixins.

*/

//*-----solution 1------*/

// The first and simplest thing to do is to impose some encapsulation for classes and mixins. Do not have all your “private” properties and methods intermingled. This will reduce the number of accidental (or deliberate) dependencies and eliminate a number of accidental name clashes.
