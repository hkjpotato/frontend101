/*
Mixins solve a very common problem in class-centric OOP: For non-trivial applications, there is a messy many-to-many relationship between behavior and classes, and it does not neatly decompose into a tree.

what does it means. Put it simple, class single inheritance let us make a tree of the class and behavior. Mixins let us make a graph(not just parent child relationship)

JavaScriptâ€™s single-inheritance model forces us to organize behavior in trees, which can only represent one-to-many relationships.

     Person
    /      \
Employee   Employer

mixins let us keep that single-inheritance of classes, and mix in behavior into individual classes as needed

function mixin(behavior) {
  let instanceKeys = Reflect.ownKeys(behavior);
  //why Reflect, because we want to enumerate private keys defined by symbol
  let typeTag = Symbol('isa');

  function _mixin(clazz) {
    for (let property of instanceKeys) {
      Object.defineProperty(clazz.prototype, property, {
        value: behavior[property],
        writable: true,
        // configurable: false,
        // enumerable: false,
      });
    }
    Object.defineProperty(clazz.prototype, typeTag, {value: true});
    return clazz;
  }

  Object.defineProperty(_mixin, Symbol.hasInstance, {
    // value: (i) => !!i[typeTag] //take an instance and check typeTag property, which is in the closure, a private property, marvellous!
    value: function(i) {
      console.log(i);
      // return !!i[typeTag];
      return true;
    }
