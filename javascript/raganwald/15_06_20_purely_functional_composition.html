//a review of http://raganwald.com/2015/06/20/purely-functional-composition.html

//key question: What if we wish to make modifications in just one place?

//modification on class I mean

//Person example is used

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.alive = true;
  }
  live() {
    this.alive = true;
    return this;
  }
  godie() {
    this.alive = false;
    return this;
  }
}

let p = new Person('Tom');



const MixCrazy = {
  goCrazy() {
    this.crazy = true;
    return this;
  },
  isCrazy() {
    return this.crazy;
  }
}

// Object.assign(Person.prototype, MixCrazy);

//the problem is, every person can go crazy now, even the old one

// p.goCrazy().isCrazy() //true

//what about use extends to solve the problem
class CrazyPerson extends Person{
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
  }
  goCrazy() {
    this.crazy = true;
    return this;
  }
  isCrazy() {
    return this.crazy;
  }
}

/*
One oft-repeated drawback of using extension is that it is difficult to share the "gocrazy" functionality with other classes. Extension forms a strict tree. Another drawback is that the functionality can only be tested in concert with Todo, whereas it is trivial to independently test a well-crafted mixin.
*/

/*
pros and cons here:
1. mixins let modification live along, but using it change your class
2. extends create new class, where modification live within it. Thus modification is not independent

We want to free our class from additional modification, we also want to free our modification from associate with a certain class
*/

//first go around, still create a new class, no leave the original one alone
//do not specify the behavior in the newly created
//specify the behavior by mixin
//mix the newly created with the mixin

//ok, we still modify the newly created, but this time instead of hard code them as class property, we specify them in a mixin.

//let's recap here again

//to make things from abstract to specific
//from simple to complex
//from general to specification
//there are two ways we know how to acheive it
/*
parent -> child, (base -> specific)

{a} => {a, b}

Extension forms a strict tree.

What we want is to decouple Todo from Coloured with extension, and to decouple Coloured from ColouredTodo with a mixin:

two decouples here:

originally by mixin (B as behavior, C as Class)
B is alone, C will be mixed with B and thus C is polluted

originally by extend (CC is extended)
B is not alone, B lives with CC as an extension to C.

You can produce man, you want to produce a man with superpower.

You can change the production line so that every man has superpower

Or You can make a new production line, and the new produced is superman(born with superpower)

Or you can store the superpower in some magic stone.

You still open up a new production line, and THEN enpowered every new produced man by superpower stone

A process of decoupling

my understand of above is that:
original mixin is like

new mixin is like
