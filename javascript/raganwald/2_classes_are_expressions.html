I got quite confused reading this article, because in terms of implementation, it shows it step by step, but in terms of concept, things just show up surprising!
*/

//The goal of this article is to show you a way to really encapusulate a class

//meaning that like in java you can have private property and expose getter and setter to the other elements.

//Normally, if you want to encapsulate a Person, which has private property like firstName and lastName, and API like fullName, you do the following

function Person (first, last) {
  this.rename(first, last);
}

Person.prototype.fullName = function fullName () {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};


Person.prototype.rename = function rename (first, last) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  return this;
}

//the problem is that outside world can still access firstName and lastName directly by p.firstName

//it solves this problem by 1.Symbol 2.IIFE closure

//a property defined by Symbol can be only accessed using bracket operator [sym1], it is not enumerable

sym1 = Symbol('a');
obj = {}
obj[sym1] = 1000;
str = sym1.toString(); //"symbol('a)"
obj[sym1] //1000 that is fine
Object.keys(obj) //[] not enumerable


//the idea is to put symbol value (property name) in a closure and thus they can't be access from outsideworld

let PersonS = (function() {
  //in the closure created by IIFE
  let firstNameProperty = Symbol('firstName'), 
      lastNameProperty = Symbol('lastName');

  let Person = class {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      this.rename(firstName, lastName);
    }
    fullName() {
      return this[firstNameProperty] + " " + this[lastNameProperty];
    }
    rename(firstName, lastName) {
      this[firstNameProperty] = firstName;
      this[lastNameProperty] = lastName;
      return this;
    }
  }
  return Person; //class is just expression
})();

var ps = new PersonS('kj', 'huang');
ps.fullName() //kj huang
ps.firstName; //undefined
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(ps); //[]
