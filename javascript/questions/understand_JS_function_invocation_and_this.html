//In my opinion, a lot of this confusion is cleared up by understanding the core function invocation primitive, and then looking at all other ways of invoking a function as sugar on top of that primitive. In fact, this is exactly how the ECMAScript spec thinks about it. In some areas, this post is a simplification of the spec, but the basic idea is the same...by article

//The Core Primitive

//The core primitive is the call method

/*
call does this
1. make an argument list argList(,,,)
2. the first param is thisValue
3. inovoke the function with this set to thisValue and argList as argument list
*/

function hello(thing) {
  console.log(this + " say hello " + thing);
}

hello.call("KJ", "world") //KJ say hello world

//1. Simple Function Invocation
//desugars: use parens syntax hello('world')

hello('world'); //desugars to hello.call(window, 'world') in browser


//In ES5, when use strict mode, it desugars to hello.call(undefined, 'world')

// The short version is: a function invocation like fn(...args) is the same as fn.call(window [ES5-strict: undefined], ...args).

// Note that this is also true about functions declared inline: (function() {})() is the same as (function() {}).call(window [ES5-strict: undefined).

//2. Memeber Functions
var person = {
  name: 'kj',
  hello: function (thing) {
    console.log(this + " say hello " + thing);
  }
}

person.hello("world") //desugars to person.hello.call(person, "world");

//Notice that the function doesn't have a persistent notion of its 'this'. It is always set at call time based upon the way it was invoked by its caller.

//3. Function.prototype.bind
//historically use a closure to convert a function into one with an unchanging this

var boundHelloWithPredefinedThis = function(thing) {
  //closure this
  _this = {name: 'closure'};
  //above create a closure, so that when the return function is called, it always access this predefined _this
  return person.hello.call(_this.name, thing);
}

boundHelloWithPredefinedThis("world");

//make it general, with dynamic this bound
var generalBind = function (func, thisValue) {
  //return a new function, this is the boundFunction
  return function() {
    return func.apply(thisValue, arguments)
  }
}

//If you understand the basic rules for converting a sugary function call into a desugared func.call(thisValue, ...args), you should be able to navigate the not so treacherous waters of the JavaScript this value...by article


//A simple JS question
var name = 'window'
function f() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

var obj = {
  name: 'obj',
  method: function(fn) {
    fn();
  }
}

obj.method(f);
//what's the output?
//obj.method() desugars to obj.method.call(obj, f);
//however when you call fn() inside method, you are not calling it as a member function, thus this should bind to window


console.log('---a little more---')

var length = 10;
function fn() {
    console.log(this.length)
};
var obj = {
    length: 5, 
    method: function (fn) {
        fn();
        arguments[0]();
        fn.call(obj, 12);
    }
};
obj.method(fn, 1); //answer should be 10, 2, 5

//10 is the global length (default)
//2 is the arguments.length (memeber method)
//5 is obj.length (explict)


//4 types of this bind
/*
1. default: window [ES5-strict: undefined]
2. implicit: as a member function of an object
3. explicit: apply, call, bind
4. new operator: constructor this
*/

//why arguments[0]() is like a member method
/*
because arguments is like an object 
{
  0: fn, //0 is a property of arguments
  1: 1
  length: 2
}

in array like object, the property can be number type
*/


console.log('---more difficult---')

//fun1
function Foo() {
    console.log('Foo called')
    getName = function () { 
        console.log('1');
    };
    return this;
}
//fun2
Foo.getName = function () {
    console.log('2');
};
//fun3
Foo.prototype.getName = function () { 
    console.log('3');
};
//fun4
var getName = function () { 
    console.log('4');
};

//fun5
function getName() { 
    console.log('5');
}

Foo.getName(); //2, think Foo as an object, using it getName memeber function (fun2)
getName(); //4, both function declaration and variable declaration get hoisted, however, function hoisted topper than variable.


Foo().getName(); //1, run Foo first, inside it, it override the global variable getName
getName();  //1, global getName has been override
new Foo.getName();  //2, Foo.getName is a like a class method, fun2, the new operator does not affect the result

// '.' has higher order than 'new', above is like new (Foo.getName())



new Foo().getName();  //3, first run Foo as constructor, log nothing, then call getName memeber method

new new Foo().getName();
//above is like outer new with param
// new (new Foo().getName)()
//further to be
// new ((new Foo()).getName)()
//thus the function to be called is Foo() memember function fun3 //3

  console.log('Cat function called');
}

Cat.getConstructor = function() {
  console.log('get constructor');
  this.name = 'constructor';

  console.log('memeber method called');
}
var result = new Cat.getConstructor();
//get constructor -> 
console.log(result) //{name: 'constructor'}
new Cat().memeberMethod();
//run as constructor -> Cat function called -> memeber method called
