/*
A getter is a method that gets the value of a specific property. A setter is a method that sets the value of a specific property. You can define getters and setters on any predefined core object or user-defined object that supports the addition of new properties. The syntax for defining getters and setters uses the object literal syntax.
*/

var o = {
    a: 7,
    //notice the the getter  fei
    get b() {
        return this.a + 1;
    }
}

console.log(o); //notice 'get b' is not the name for getter, the name for getter is 'b'
/*
In principle, getters and setters can be either
1. defined using object initializers, or
2. added later to any object at any time using a getter or setter adding method.
*/

Object.defineProperty(o, 'value', {
    get: function() { console.log('run getter of value');},
    set: function(x) {
        console.log('run setter of value');
    }
});

console.log(o.value);
o.value = 1;

/*
Getters and setters can also be added to an object at any time after creation using the Object.defineProperties method. This method's first parameter is the object on which you want to define the getter or setter. The second parameter is an object whose property names are the getter or setter names, and whose property values are objects for defining the getter or setter functions. Here's an example that defines the same getter and setter used in the previous example:

*/
//define the name of getter and setter function
Object.defineProperties(o, {
    'get_sth': {get: function() {return this.sth}, set: function(x) {this.sth = x}}
})

o.sth = 'hkj';

console.log(o.get_sth)
// console.log(o.get_sth)
o.get_sth = 'potato'

// delete o.sth

console.log(o)


//delete property delete o.get_sth


//comparing object
/*
In JavaScript objects are a reference type. Two distinct objects are never equal, even if they have the same properties. Only comparing the same object reference with itself yields true.
