//Property inheritance revisited
/*
Local versus inherited values

When you access an object property, JavaScript performs these steps, as described earlier in this chapter:

1. Check to see if the value exists locally. If it does, return that value.
2. If there is not a local value, check the prototype chain (using the __proto__ property).
3. If an object in the prototype chain has a value for the specified property, return that value.
4. If no such property is found, the object does not have the property.

function Employee() {
    this.name = '';
    this.dept = 'general';
}

function WorkerBee() {
    this.projects = [];

}
WorkerBee.prototype = new Employee;

var amy = new WorkerBee;


/*
amy.name == "" //from _proto_ -> new Employee.name
amy.dept == "general" //from __proto_ -> new Employee.dept
amy.projects == [] //from local
*/

Employee.prototype.name = "unknown"
Employee.prototype.sth = "sth"


/*
amy.name == ""
because amy.__proto__ has a local name = ""; it wont look up to the _proto_ of the new Employee

amy.sth == "sth" //amy.__proto__.__proto__.sth
*/

console.log(amy.sth);
console.log(amy.name);

If you want to change the value of an object property at run time and have the new value be inherited by all descendants of the object, you cannot define the property in the object's constructor function. Instead, you add it to the constructor's associated prototype.

Property lookup in JavaScript looks within an object's own properties and, if the property name is not found, it looks within the special object property __proto__. This continues recursively; the process is called "lookup in the prototype chain".

The special property __proto__ is set when an object is constructed(by constructor function); it is set to the value of the constructor's prototype property. So the expression new Foo() creates an object with __proto__ == Foo.prototype. Consequently, changes to the properties of Foo.prototype alters the property lookup for all objects that were created by new Foo().

Every object has a __proto__ object property (except Object); every function has a prototype object property. So objects can be related by 'prototype inheritance' to other objects. You can test for inheritance by comparing an object's __proto__ to a function's prototype object. JavaScript provides a shortcut: the instanceof operator tests an object against a function and returns true if the object inherits from the function prototype. For example,
*/
function Foo() {

}
var f = new Foo();
console.log(f instanceof Foo) //true


var y = {};
y.__proto__ = Foo.prototype;
console.log(f instanceof Foo) //true



//detailed example
function GrandParent() {

}

//notice GrandParent.prototype is Object, Object does not have __proto__ (null)
console.log(GrandParent.prototype);

function Parent() {

}

Parent.prototype = new GrandParent();


function Child() {

}

Child.prototype = new Parent();

var child1 = new Child();
//below are all true
console.log(child1.__proto__ == Child.prototype); 
console.log(child1.__proto__.__proto__ == Parent.prototype);
/*
child1 is an instance of Child (C)
because child1.__proto__ point to the constructor's prototype
which is an instance of Parent (P)
thus (P) also has __proto__ point to the constructors' prototype
which is an instance of GrandParent(GP)
*/

console.log(child1.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__); //Object
//because GP's constructor's prototype is an Object
console.log(child1.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ == Object.prototype); //== Object.prototype;
console.log(child1.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__); //null object has no __proto__


var a = {}; //think of it as var a = new Object();
console.log(a.__proto__ == Object.prototype) //true
console.log(Object.prototype) //a collection of native code

/*Ok I know this is confusing...spend more time on it*/
console.log('---------');
/*maybe think of Object as a pure key value set
Object = {
    prototype: {???};
}

var a= new Object();
a.__proto__ -> Object.prototype


function Foo() {
    
}

var f = new Foo(); //by default set f.__proto__ = Foo.prototype -> which is an object create by Object();
*/

function instanceOf(object, constructor) {
    constructor_prototype = object.__proto__; //get the prototype of constructor
    while (constructor_prototype != null) {
        if (constructor_prototype == constructor.prototype) {
            return true;
        }

Understanding the difference between Object.create() and new SomeFunction()


Here are the steps that happen internally for both calls:
(Hint: the only difference is in step 3)

new Test():

1. create new Object() obj
2. set obj.__proto__ to Test.prototype
3. return Test.call(obj) || obj;
// normally obj is returned but constructors in JS can return a value

Object.create( Test.prototype )

1. create new Object() obj
2. set obj.__proto__ to Test.prototype
3. return obj;
So basically Object.create doesn't execute the constructor.

function Person() {
    this.personname = 'personname';
}

Person.prototype = {
    attr1: 'human',
    attr2: 'earth'
}

var p1 = new Person(); //have personname, attr1, attr2
var p2 = Object.create(Person.prototype);
console.log(p1.personname); //personname
console.log(p2.personname); //undefined

console.log(p2.__proto__ == p1.__proto__); //true

console.log(p2);
