var mark = new WorkerBee;
/*
When JavaScript sees the new operator, it creates a new generic object and passes this new object as the value of the this keyword to the WorkerBee constructor function. The constructor function explicitly sets the value of the projects property, 

and IMPLICITLY!!! sets the value of the internal __proto__ property to the value of WorkerBee.prototype. (That property name has two underscore characters at the front and two at the end.) The __proto__ property determines the prototype chain used to return property values. Once these properties are set, JavaScript returns the new object and the assignment statement sets the variable mark to that object.

This process does not explicitly put values in the mark object (local values) for the properties that mark inherits from the prototype chain. When you ask for the value of a property, JavaScript first checks to see if the value exists in that object. If it does, that value is returned. If the value is not there locally, JavaScript checks the prototype chain (using the __proto__ property). If an object in the prototype chain has a value for the property, that value is returned. If no such property is found, JavaScript says the object does not have the property. In this way, the mark object has the following properties and values:

mark.name = '';
mark.dept = 'general';
mark.projects = [];
