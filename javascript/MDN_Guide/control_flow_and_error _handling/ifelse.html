/*
A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements: if...else and switch.
*/


/*
if (condition) {
  statement_1;
} else {
  statement_2;
}

Here the condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false.

expression is also a statement

/*
BUG might happen here! sometimes we just forget to use == but instead use =

it is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
if (x = y) {
    statements here
}

If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

if ((x = y)) {
    statements here
}

/*
Most Important of this chapter!
Falsy values
-false
-undefined
-null
-0
-NaN
-empty string ""

all other values, including all objects, evaluate to true!

Do not confuse the primitive boolean values true and false with the true and false values of the Boolean object. For example:
*/

console.log(!!undefined);

console.log(!!0);

console.log(!!NaN);

console.log(!!"");

console.log(!!null);

/*all false*/





var b = new Boolean(false);

if (b) {
    console.log('object is always true')
}

if (!(b == true)) {
    console.log('equal condition evaluate to false')
}

if ((a = 100)) {
    console.log('assignment is true')
}
