Any JavaScript expression is also a statement

Statement can be separated by ";"

Statements can be written in single line
Block statement
The most basic statement is a block statement that is used to group statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets:
{
    statement_1;
    statement_2;
    ...
}

Block statements are commonly used with control flow statements (e.g. if, for, while).

if (x == y) {
    statement_1;
}

Important: JavaScript prior to ECMAScript2015 does not have block scope. Variables introduced within a block are scoped to the containing function or script, and the effects of setting them persist beyond the block itself. In other words, block statements do not define a scope. "Standalone" blocks in JavaScript can produce completely different results from what they would produce in C or Java. For example:

var x = 1;
{
    var x = 2;
}
console.log(x); //2 this is because statement var x = 2 is in the same scope of console.log(x) 

Starting with ECMAScript2015, the let variable declaration is block scoped. See the let reference page for more information.

*/

var x = 1; var y = 2; // single line

if (true) {
    var x = 100;
    let y = 99;
}

console.log(x, y) //100, 2
