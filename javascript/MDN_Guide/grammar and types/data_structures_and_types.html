/*
The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

Six data types that are primitives:
    Boolean. true and false.
    null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
    undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
    Number. 42 or 3.14159.
    String. "Howdy"
    Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.

and Object

/*
Data type conversion

In expressions involving numeric and string values with the + operator, JavaScript converts numeric values to strings. For example, consider the following statements:
*/

console.log("37" + 7) //'377' string conversion
console.log("37" - 7) // 30(num) '-' will not do string conversion
console.log([1, 2] + [2]) //1,22 what happen is js convert array into string and concat those


/*

In the case that a value representing a number is in memory as a string, there are methods for conversion.

parseInt()
parseFloat()


An alternative method of retrieving a number from a string is with the + (unary plus) operator:

'1.1' + '1.1' = '1.11.1'
(+'1.1') + (+'1.1') = 2.2   
// Note: the parentheses are added for clarity, not required.
