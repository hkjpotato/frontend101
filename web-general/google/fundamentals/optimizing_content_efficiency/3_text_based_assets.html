//Minimize the overall download size by optimizing and compressing the remaining resources.


/*-----------------
Data compression 101


1. generic tool in server
2. preprocess of specific content types(JS CSS)
3. resource specific


Compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits.

very good example to show the basic idea of compression algorithms

---original---
# Below is a secret message, which consists of a set of headers in
# key-value format followed by a newline and the encrypted message.
format: secret-cipher
date: 08/25/16

---result---
format: secret-cipher

/*-----------------
Minification: preprocessing & context-specific optimizations


blablabla

 preprocessing/minification/context-aware can be useful beyond simple compressor

again, 
1. eliminate comment
2. content specific optimization, like collapse css rule
3. whitespace


In short, as a first step in optimizing the efficiency of your assets, build an inventory of the different content types and consider what kinds of content-specific optimizations you can apply to reduce their size. Then, after youâ€™ve figured out what they are, automate these optimizations by adding them to your build and release processes to ensure that the optimizations are applied...by article

/*-----------------
Text compression with GZIP

1. Apply content-specific optimizations first: CSS, JS, and HTML minifiers.
2. Apply GZIP to compress the minified output.
