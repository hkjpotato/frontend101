//If you're using console.log() to find and fix bugs in your code, consider using the workflow outlined in this tutorial instead. It's often much faster and more effective...by article

//DevTools lets you pause your code in the middle of its execution, and examine the values of all variables at that moment in time. The tool for pausing your code is called a breakpoint. Try it now:

//I did not know that!!always console console console....

//There are different types of breakpoint, not just the one in source code. We can trigger event based breakpoints as well.

//step into vs step over

//Line-of-code breakpoints are the most common type of breakpoint

//One DevTools alternative to console.log() is Watch Expressions

//A second DevTools alternative to console.log() is the Console. Use the Console to evaluate arbitrary JavaScript statements. Developers commonly use the Console to overwrite the variable values when debugging

//To fix by editing the code and re-running the demo. You don't need to leave DevTools to apply the fix. You can edit JavaScript code directly within the DevTools UI.
