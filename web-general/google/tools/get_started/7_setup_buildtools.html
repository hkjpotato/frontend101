/*
every site should have a development version and a production version.

The development version has everthing (JS, CSS, Image)

The production version will take these files, minify them, concatenate/merge them and optimise files like images.

1. Build process need to care about optimise for performance->automaticallly minify and concatenate into production version
2. Use tools like LiveReload to make your development process smoother...I doubt. I still feel like the best starting point for a beginner is a simple MAMP or codepen to write static HTML, CSS< JS
...by the way, if you are writing React or other state related frontend, you need Hot Reload instead of Live Reload (you need to maintain the state)

/*-----------------
Build Process
A build process is a set of tasks from development to deployment.

..."a set of tasks which run over your projects files, compiling and testing code during development and used to create the deployment version of your site. Your build process shouldn't be a set of tasks you run at the end of your development workflow."


Popular tools are Gulp and Grunt, and Webpack of course.

Tasks in build process

It recommends the Web Starter Kit...man..it is not easy to start for me. I mean, I wish to know more about NodeJS before I touch them. But before NodeJS I wish to know more about Module Pattern in JS.

--- concatenation & minification ---
concatenation: file1 + file2 = file_out

-tools: CSS(gulp-sasss) JS(gulp-useref) HTML(why you want to concatenate HTML?) 


minification: file1(100kb) -> file1_min(10kb)

-tools: CSS(gulp-csso) JS(gulp-ugliy) HTML(gulp-minify-html) 


--- optimize images ---
They have a tool on content optimization of images, a lot of stuff from png, svg to blablabla

but basically, you can remove the meta data.

-tools: gulp-imagemin


--- autoprefix ---
This is different from sublime autoprefix plugin. They do them same actually, but gulp-autoprefixed add the prefix to your production code.

-tools gulp-autoprefixer

--- live reloading ---
I guess they use socket to do that. It is amazing. You change your code, and it automatically get updated... How can we do that by a stateless http call?

-tools: browser-sync

//I am going to learn the gulp based starter kit, use it for my personal website.

//I am still going to use webpack for my react project.
