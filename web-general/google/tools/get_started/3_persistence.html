//Chrome DevTools lets you change elements and styles on a web page and see your changes immediately. 

//but By default, they will gone if you refresh

//Now I get confused about the idea of using a workspace to save those change we made in DevTools.

//Let's follow the example
//https://developers.google.com/web/tools/setup/setup-workflow

//The basic idea is when you change in chrome you can update the local file...I am not making a lot of change in chrome devTools so this is not that useful for me at this momement. Though, the idea of map resource is important.
