//Why use a package manager?

//Package managers make it easy to find, install, and keep packages & plugins up-to-date.

/*
Package managers make it very easy to find, install, and update plugins:

In the Sublime Text editor, open your package manager (ctrl+shift+p).//mac command instead of ctrl
Enter 'Install Package'.
Enter the name of the plugin you are looking for (or else browse all plugins).


//Use Install Package, I install

//Autoprefixer
//ColorPicker...not that useful, I still prefer the Hex Color website.
//HTML-CSS-JS prettify...it's ok
