#Web History

## Born of Web
Web is a short of World Wide Web. Today, "internet" has more meaning than its technical identification. Some people use it as a business strategy. However, in its root, internet is a network generated by a group of computer by the TCP/IP protocol. The initial web is static, using HTML as a standard format to describe information, URI to locate the information, HTTP to communicate with each other. Thus, early web is a combination of three standards: HTML, URL and HTTP.

Below is an illustration to show the relationship between a browser and a web server

## Dynamic Content (CGI)
Early web service is only about static content, like text and image. In 1993, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is created. What CGI does is to identify the standard for communication between a web server and other applications, so that the web server can use it to interact with other applications to generate dynamic content.

## Web Script Language
The problem of CGI is that for every request, it will start a new process, thus its performance is not as expected. And it is hard to develop since writing the HTML in C could be nightmare. If you try the vanillaJS tutorial of TodoMVC you know the workload. A solution is to have a template for the common static part of html, and then inject the dynamic content by the web script language, such as PHP.
