One challenge of front end development is that the universities normally don't teach front end specific courses. They only teach you about OO language, database and basic knowledge about computing.

I have gained help from different people and varous online resource. Thus here I want to keep summarizing waht I know about front end development and share with anyone who is interested in becoming a front end/UI developer.
