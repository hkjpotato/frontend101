      //recap of what store need to do

      //1. store will hold the state, and getState will return it.
      //2. dispatch accept an action. Internally, it will call the reducer and update the state it holds
      //3. subscribe will listen to the change of the state, when there is a change it will call the callback passed in.


      const createStore = (reducer) => {
        let state;
        //why we need a list? because subscribe can be called many times, we need to keep track of all listeners. This is like observer pattern.
        let listeners = [];

        const getState = () => state;
        const dispatch = (action) => {
          //dispatch do two things
          //1. update the state using the passed in action (& original state)
          state = reducer(state, action);
          //2. run through the listeners and call each of them
          listeners.forEach(listener=>listener());
        };
        const subscribe = (listener) => {
          listeners.push(listener);
          //oh we need to deal with unsubscribe here, we return a function that when it is called, it will remove the current listener (in this closure)
          return () => {
            listeners = listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
          }
