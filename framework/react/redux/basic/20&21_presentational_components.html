      //These 3 chapters will use React as our UI component, but first, let's recap what we know about redux.

      //Reducer: a pure function that accept the prevState and action and return the nextState
      // we are going to make 3 reducers: 1.todo; 2.todos; 3:filter

      //Store: the hub of redux framework
      /*
      1. it holds the current app state
      2. it holds the reducer(init with that reducer) who know how to modify the state
      3. whats missing? well, we have the state, we have the state modifier(reducer), we also need to let other guys to interact with it: it let the other guy to send signal(action) about the state change.

      Think of store as StateManager, and reducer as StateModifier.

      Let's implement it.
