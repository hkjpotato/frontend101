      //These 3 chapters will use React as our UI component, but first, let's recap what we know about redux.

      //Reducer: a pure function that accept the prevState and action and return the nextState
      // we are going to make 3 reducers: 1.todo; 2.todos; 3:filter

      //Store: the hub of redux framework
      /*
      1. it holds the current app state
      2. it holds the reducer(init with that reducer) who know how to modify the state
      3. whats missing? well, we have the state, we have the state modifier(reducer), we also need to let other guys to interact with it: it let the other guy to send signal(action) about the state change.

      Think of store as StateManager, and reducer as StateModifier.

      Let's implement it.

      Attention:
      while the p&c pattern is good for redux?
      it is good for every react app
      good for every js complex

      but since container is where the behavior is hold
      and in redux mode

      behavior need to dispatch the store, you wont deal with it locally

      it is a good place for you to deal with behavior

      the downside of single container is obvious

      a lot of intermediate components work as props passer

      intermediate props passer is a break of encapsulation,
      because parent need to know too much about child
      child is not a good encapsulation of certain behavior or state
