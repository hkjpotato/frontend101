      //A reducer calculates the next state tree based on the previous state tree and the action be dispatched

      //Thing to know: the UI is most predictable when it is described as a pure function of the application state. (Think about functional component in React, we are going to say Bye to class component).

      //In redux, not only the UI is a pure function of state, but the state change is managed by a pure function as well.

      //This is even true in large app where it has a large state. The state change is controlled by a pure function (oldstate, action) => newstate


      //third principle: to describe state mutation, we have to use a pure function to take previous state, and action being dispatched, and return the next state of the app. This function has to be pure. It is called reducer.
      const Counter = ({state, sthListenToAction}) => (
        <div>
          <h1>{state.value}</h1>
          <button onClick={()=>sthListenToAction({type: 'ADD'})}>+</button>
          <button onClick={()=>sthListenToAction({type: 'MINUS'})}>-</button>
        </div>
      )

      //Now we know those 3 principles, let's try to make a reducer, which take a prevState and action and then return a new state
      function reducer(prevState, action) {
        let newState = Object.assign({}, prevState);
        switch (action.type) {
          case 'ADD':
            newState.value++;
            break;
          case 'MINUS':
            newState.value--;
        }
        return newState;
      }

      //let's have a blackbox wrapper, it has its own state, it can listen to action, it can react to the action by render the UI
      var blackbox = {
        state: {value: 0},
        listenToAction: function(action) {
          console.log(this);
          this.state = reducer(this.state, action);
          this.render();
        },

            <Counter state={this.state} sthListenToAction={this.listenToAction.bind(this)} />,
            document.getElementById('app')
          );
        }
      }
      //you will see this is actually similar the store of the redux library provided

      //you will see what's the major functions of this blackbox
      //1. it must hold the state
      //2. it should be able to accept action, and mutate the state by reducer
      //3. when there is a change in state, it will trigger some action.
