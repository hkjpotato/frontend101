        /*
        I think this problem on whether to store the state has been confused me a lot when I need to make a child element, such as a popup form. My general approach is to set the initial state of the form from props. Then when the user change it, it just updated its own state (or make it an uncontrolled form). The problem is that if the parent updates the props of this form, those changes made by the user will be lost.
        */

        /*
        This document is not solving this problem directly, it talks abot a case when several child components need to share the changing data. In this case, the parent should hold the public, common state.
        */

        /*Let's follow its example*/

        //First, create a pure functional component called BoilingVerdict
        function BoilingVerdict(props) {
            if (props.celsius >= 100) {
                return <p>the water would boil.</p>;
            }
            return <p>The water would not boil.</p>;
        }

        //since we already learn conditional rendering, we can rewrite it in a simpler format
        function BoilingVerdict(props) {
            return props.celsius >= 100 ?
            <p>the water would boil.</p> :
            <p>The water would not boil.</p>
        }

                this.state = {temperature: ''}; //we use empty string instead of null to get rid of the warning
            }
            handleChange(e) {
                this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});

        //OK a new requirement on Fahrenheit input and they are kept in sync

        //In sync...it means that when you change your f input, c will be change, and vice versa

        //Wait, in that case, how many temperature do we have in total? Well, we only have one 'generic' temperature value. The difference is the scale

        //Immediately you see the problem, how does this input notify its parent about the temperature change? How does its sibling, the BoilingVerdict, get the temperature as input? This is where we need to lift the state up.

        /*
            In summary, we have 1 problem here:
            Child element's own state cannot be accessed outside itself, neither by its parent, nor its sibling
        */

        //we can use callback to notify its parent about its states change. However, a more valuable question to be asked is whether we should keep those as its own states.

        //Let's continue

          return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

          return rounded.toString();
        }
        //I am confused why React choose this example as there are some unrelated stuffs.

            blablacbla...
            The key is 
            1. In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called "lifting state up". 
            2. The ancestor now becomes the  "source of truth" of the state. The children get the state as a prop.

If we render this in dom and change the input value, nothing happened. Because this poor input field is now 'controlled' by the value passing as a prop from its ancestor. Since it is controlled by its ancestor (you are the boss, ancestor), the ancestor also need to let it knows what to do when there is a change. This is why onTemperatureChange is passed as a props from the ancestor.



        /* Lessons Learned (most important)
         There should be a single "source of truth" for any data that changes in a React application. Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the top-down data flow.
