        /*
        Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

        An element describes what you want to see on the screen:

        const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;

        above is the same as the one created by React.createElement, a js Object

        Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain (JS)objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.


        elements make up component!
        */

        //these things below are the same
        React.createElement('h1', {style: {color: 'red'}}, "the text");

        <h1 style={{color: 'red'}}>the text</h1>

        React.DOM.h1({color: 'red'}, "the text");

        //Convenience wrappers around React.createElement() for DOM components are provided by React.DOM. For example, React.DOM.a(...) is a convenience wrapper for React.createElement('a', ...). They are considered legacy, and we encourage you to either use JSX or use React.createElement() directly instead.

        //use ReactDOM to render react element into the root DOM node.

        //React elements are immutable. You cant change children or attributes after created. An element is like a frame in a movie, which represents the UI at a certain point in time...interesting, then how we update this 'frame'?

         //thus base on our knowledge so far, we can only update the UI by calling reactDOM.render with another new created element



        // Update Example
         function update() {
            //use const since element is immutable
            const element = makeElement(Math.random());
            ReactDOM.render(
                element,
                document.getElementById('app')
            );
         }

         function makeElement(val) {
            console.log('js call');
            return React.createElement(
                'p',
                null,
                "hello",
                React.createElement(
                    "span",
                    {style : {color: 'red'}},
                    val
                )
            );
        }
         setInterval(update, 1000);



         //In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.

         //if you check chrome developer tool you will see only val is updated.

         //React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

         //so even you call the render multiple times on the whole UI element, only the part changed will be updated.

        //what is the difference between ReactDOM.render and render function in a component?
