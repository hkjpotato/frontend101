    Things to know:
    JSX is not template language, it comes with JS.
    
    Wrap multi-lines JSX in parentheses to avoid the automatic semicolon insertion.

    What does the raw js look like, you may wonder.

    Well, after compilation, JSX experession become regular JS objects!!!!! created by React.createElement!!

    Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children)
