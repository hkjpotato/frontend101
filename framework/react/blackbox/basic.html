  The source code says:
  "Renders a React component into the DOM in the supplied `container`.

  If the React component was previously rendered into `container`, this will
  perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the
  latest React component."

  Let's see how it makes it.

  Below is the function definition
  render: function (nextElement, container, callback) {
    return ReactMount._renderSubtreeIntoContainer(null, nextElement, container, callback);
  }

  The nextElement is the element the 'basic' element we created.
  container is the actual dom root node.
  callback is undefined in this case.
  
  The rough sequence:
  1. check if the element is an valid React element
  2. create a wrapper element called nextWrappedElement, its props.child is the passed in element
  3. try to get prevCompenent of the container (return null)
  4. getReactRootElementInContainer based on container, which is null again
  5. then go into _renderNewRootComponent
    - instantiateReactComponent
      -make instance._currentElement's child is the 'basic' element
      -a lot of event hooks...I dont understand..
      -a method under ReactCompositeComponenet called mountComponent is called
        -Initialize the component, renders markup, and registers event listeners
      -wow, I see the clean up process of previous child //while(container.lastChild) {container.removeChild(container.lastChild); }
      -wow, I see how React do the real markup rendering..insertBefore
        -insertTreeBefore, insertTreeChildren
    - I see sth like this:
      // The initial render is synchronous but any updates that happen during
      // rendering, in componentWillMount or componentDidMount, will be batched
      // according to the current batching strategy.
    -return componentInstance


  I see that if 'development' !== 'production', then React do a lot extra stuffs
    - emitEvent
    - define debugID

  /*
  What happen if I click the button to trigger the render again
    1. still create the nextWrappedElement
    2. this time getReactRootElementInContainer will return the h1 dom node, we call it rootEl
    3. get prevHostInstance..what..in the closure it has an internalInstanceKey, using that it get the ReactDOMCoponent...React use a lot of closure to store those stuffs I guess
    4. now we have the prevComponent, which is a wrapper of the above
    5. check the prevElement, use shouldUpdateReactComponent to compare prevElement and nextElement
    6.  return true
      - getNodeFromInstance (get the dom node from ReactDOMComponent or ReactDOMTextComponent), by accessing _hostNode...ok, react, like d3, all store a reference to the actual dom node, assign it to publicInst
      - call ReactMount._updateRootComponent
      - push the update to ReactUpdateQueue
      ...magic happen in dirty component checking..
