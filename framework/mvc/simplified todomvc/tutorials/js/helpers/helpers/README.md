#helpers/helpers.js
It is not related to MVC framework, just some helpers function to wrap the querySelector and event attach functions.

Note that it uses event delegation technique to handle event from dom list. Remember that for "focus" and "blur" event, they don't have the bubbling phase and thus it set the useCapture to be true to detect those two events.



```javascript
(function (window) {
	'use strict';

	// Get element(s) by CSS selector:
	// scope here can be a parent dom node
	window.qs = function (selector, scope) {
		return (scope || document).querySelector(selector);
	};
	window.qsa = function (selector, scope) {
		return (scope || document).querySelectorAll(selector);
	};

	// addEventListener wrapper:
	window.$on = function (target, type, callback, useCapture) {
		target.addEventListener(type, callback, !!useCapture);
	};

	// Attach a handler to event for all elements that match the selector,
	// now or in the future, based on a root element
	window.$delegate = function (target, selector, type, handler) {
		function dispatchEvent(event) {
			var targetElement = event.target;
			var potentialElements = window.qsa(selector, target);
			//notice that NodeList does not have array function by itself
			var hasMatch = Array.prototype.indexOf.call(potentialElements, targetElement) >= 0;

			if (hasMatch) {
				handler.call(targetElement, event);
			}
		}

		// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/blur
		//if event type is blur or focus, use capture phase to detect those event.
		var useCapture = type === 'blur' || type === 'focus';

		window.$on(target, type, dispatchEvent, useCapture);
	};

	// Find the element's parent with the given tag name:
	// $parent(qs('a'), 'div');
	window.$parent = function (element, tagName) {
		if (!element.parentNode) {
			return;
		}
		if (element.parentNode.tagName.toLowerCase() === tagName.toLowerCase()) {
			return element.parentNode;
		}
		return window.$parent(element.parentNode, tagName);
	};

	// Allow for looping on nodes by chaining:
	// qsa('.foo').forEach(function () {})
	NodeList.prototype.forEach = Array.prototype.forEach;
})(window);
```

Why is NodeList not an Array?(from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList#Why_is_NodeList_not_an_Array))

NodeList are used very much like arrays and it's tempting to invoke Array.prototype methods on them, however NodeList objects don't have any of the familiar Array methods.

JavaScript has an inheritance mechanism based on prototypes for both builtâ€“in objects (like Arrays) and host objects (like NodeLists). Array instances inherit array methods (such as forEach or map) because their prototype chain looks like the following:

```myArray --> Array.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null (The prototype chain of an object can be obtained by calling Object.getPrototypeOf several times.)```

forEach, map and the likes are own properties of the Array.prototype object.

Unlike arrays, NodeList prototype chain looks like the following:

```myNodeList --> NodeList.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null```

NodeList.prototype contains the item method, but none of the Array.prototype methods, so they cannot be used on NodeLists.
