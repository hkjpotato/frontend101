# Backgroud

I was confused about the idea of using build tools when I first came into terms like "browersify", "CMD", "AMD" and task runners like "gulp" and "grunt". I did not come from a CS undergraduate background, with little experience with software development. For me as an HCI student, I was attracted by the "WOW" moment of the UI, and focused most on the styling of the interface. I didn't realize the value of these tools, until I started building my own web app. Among all the materials I read, I feel the following two are the most helpful and clear to understand the basic idea behind different tools: 

__why we want to use them?__ 

And I highly recommend them to you.

  * [CommonJS: Why and How](https://0fps.net/2013/01/22/commonjs-why-and-how/)  My favourite article about modularizing JS. Use it as a base to extend your knowledge to CommonJS, AMD, CDN, makefile, browserify and other bundle methods
  * [npm vs bower vs browserify vs gulp vs grunt vs webpack](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35062852/npm-vs-bower-vs-browserify-vs-gulp-vs-grunt-vs-webpack)
  * [my summery of front end tool comparison](./compare_of_frontend_tools.html)

__know about module__ 
after you got and ideas of the difference among 'pakage managerr', 'task runner' and 'module', you can check my summary of [module](./module), I try to show a list of [basic examples](./module/basic) of different module patterns (IIFE, AMD, commonJS, UMD, ES6) and I focus on the [webpack](./module/webpack/) study.
