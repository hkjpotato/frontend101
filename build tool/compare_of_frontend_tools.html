//What on earth the difference between NPM vs Bower vs Gulp vs Grunt vs Webpack..


//They are different stuffs

/*----------------
Package Manager

Package manager simplify installing and updating project dependencies, which are libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap

Without it, you need to download, copy and update the library yourself

--- NPM---
stands for: Node JS package manager
NPM does nested dependency tree, e.g.

project root
[node_modules] // default directory for dependencies
 -> dependency A
 -> dependency B
    [node_modules]
    -> dependency A

 -> dependency C
    [node_modules]
    -> dependency B
      [node_modules]
       -> dependency A 
    -> dependency D

--- Bower ---
for front-end package manager
Bower does flat dependency tree, e.g.

project root
[bower_components] // default directory for dependencies
 -> dependency A
 -> dependency B // needs A
 -> dependency C // needs B and D
 -> dependency D

/*----------------
Task Runner
Gulp, Grunt...

Task runners and build tools are primarily command-line tools. Why we need to use them: In one word: automation. 

"The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting which previously cost us a lot of times to do with command line or even manually."

/*----------------
Module Loader/Bundling 

Two separate things

In server side
If you use Node, you have module as a built in feature, meaning you can do CommonJS style module pattern (require, export)


In browser side
Browser does not have module feature. Thus to let multiple JS module to work, we need to bundle them in server first.

//depending on the module pattern 

//you can use requireJS for amd, which is essentially use ajax to get script and use callback same as AMD.

//you can use browserify/webpack to bundle the commonJS module in server into a huge bundle, the idea behind is an register system.
