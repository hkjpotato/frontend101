#Backgroud

I was confused about the idea of using build tools when I first came into terms like "browersify", "CMD", "AMD" and task runners like "gulp" and "grunt". I did not come from a CS undergraduate background, with little experience with software development. For me as an HCI student, I was attracted by the "WOW" moment of the UI, and focused most on the styling of the interface. I didn't realize the value of these tools, until I start build my own web app. Among all the materials I read, I feel like the following two are the most helpful and clear to understand the idea behind different tools.

  * [CommonJS: Why and How](https://0fps.net/2013/01/22/commonjs-why-and-how/)  My favourite article about modularizing JS. Use it as a base to extend your knowledge to CommonJS, AMD, CDN, makefile, browserify and other bundle methods
  * [npm vs bower vs browserify vs gulp vs grunt vs webpack](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35062852/npm-vs-bower-vs-browserify-vs-gulp-vs-grunt-vs-webpack)

 As mentioned in the first article:

	"However, while there are many good reasons to use JavaScript, it has a reputation for scaling poorly with project size.  In my opinion, the main cause of this is that JavaScript lacks anything even remotely resembling a coherent module system.  This omission makes it inordinately difficult to apply sensible practices like:

	* Hiding implementation details behind interfaces
	* Splitting large projects into multiple files
	* Reusing functionality from libraries and other code bases
	
	"
