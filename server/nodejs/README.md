<!-- ####  CommonJS:
This is the base for NodeJS. 
 * [CommonJS: Why and How](https://0fps.net/2013/01/22/commonjs-why-and-how/)

"However, while there are many good reasons to use JavaScript, it has a reputation for scaling poorly with project size.  In my opinion, the main cause of this is that JavaScript lacks anything even remotely resembling a coherent module system.  This omission makes it inordinately difficult to apply sensible practices like:

* Hiding implementation details behind interfaces
* Splitting large projects into multiple files
* Reusing functionality from libraries and other code bases"
